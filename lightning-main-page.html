                <p>General overview on how a LIGHTNING occurs</p>
                <p>Lightning is a leading cause of injury and death from 
                        weather-related hazards. Although most lightning victims survive,
                         people struck by lightning often report a variety of long-term, debilitating symptoms</p>
                <h3><u>Lightning can:</u></h3>
                <p>Create hail resulting in ice cubes ice which damages brittle materials.</p>            
                <p>Causes flash floodings and tornadoes.</p>                
                <p>Cause powerful winds over 50 MPH.</p>

                    <h1>Prepare before a Lightning</h1>
                    <p>&#9632 •	Know your area’s risk for thunderstorms. In most places, they can occur year-round and at any hour
                            Remove dead or rotting trees and branches that could fall and cause injury or damage during a severe thunderstorm.</p>
                    <p>&#9632 emember the 30/30 lightning safety rule: Go indoors if, after seeing lightning, you cannot count to 30 before hearing thunder. Stay indoors for 30 minutes after hearing the last clap of thunder.
                            Thunderstorms.Postpone outdoor activities.</p>
                    <p>&#9632Remember, rubber-soled shoes and rubber tires provide NO protection from lightning. However, the steel frame 
                        of a hard-topped vehicle provides increased protection if you are not touching metal.</p>
                    <p>&#9632 Avoid showering or bathing. Plumbing and bathroom fixtures can conduct electricity.
                            Use a corded telephone only for emergencies. Cordless and cellular telephones are safe to use.</p>
                    <p>&#9632 Use your battery-operated NOAA Weather Radio for updates from local officials.
                            Secure outdoor objects that could blow away or cause damage.</p>

                        <h2>DEMONSTRATION ON BUILDING LIGHTNING RESISTANT BUILDINGS</h2>
                        <p>FOLLOW THESE STEPS TO BUILD YOUR LIGHTNING RESISTANT BULDING</p>
                        <p>Although many of today’s brand-new homes are safer than older homes,
                             it’s not a rule that you must start from scratch. By performing a 
                             few must-have modifications it’s possible to increase your home’s 
                             protection from lightning.</p>
                        <p> Grounding<br>
                            Lightning Rods are the most familiar grounding protection. Ben Franklin understood the theory of making a 
                            lightning target and directing the resultant strike harmlessly to the ground. Different designs work in different 
                            environments and meet different requirements. The wires over utility substations act as lightning rods,
                             although we call them air terminals today. Other applications are definitely not suited for air terminals like the munitions 
                            dump in New Jersey or where electronics need to be protected within structures. A Faraday Cage is a good choice for those buildings.</p>
                        <p> Transients and Surges<br>
                            To a lightning bolt building wiring, fuses and circuit breakers are all the same. They’re all conductors. 
                            They’re also not capable of dealing with the extreme flow of current suddenly added to the system
                             by lightning. These lightning-induced transients are controlled with Transient Voltage Surge Suppressor (TVSS) 
                             equipment. They’re our high tech answer to a switch that shuts off power as soon as any rise is identified.
                              A TVSS shunts, filters, clamps or blocks energy from traveling down the wire. Getting the right combination
                               of methods requires a partner who understands the equipment, codes and standards,</p>
                        <p>  Detection<br>
                            There is a lot of controversy about being able to detect lightning and then being 
                            able to detect it in time to avoid damage. One aim of detection is to be able to 
                            switch from AC line power to standby power. This way the system is not interrupted
                             and the main AC power is not subject to lightning damage. We recommend a plan on 
                             what is to be protected, what is the cost and what is the level of confidence you 
                             need. double-panel system should be used throughout the home when
                                 possible.</p>
                        <p>Direct the Wind Path Away From Your Home<br>
                            Homeowners can take measures to direct a heavy wind load away 
                            from the roof and walls and towards the home’s foundation. This 
                            can be done with the help of tie-down straps, hurricane plates, and
                             clips, cable ties, and other types of tie-down products. It’s easiest 
                             to direct wind away from a one-story home, rather than a home of multiple levels.</p>
                             <p>Remain Vigilant<br>
                                Lightning is out there. Weather, time, changes to the building and maintenance 
                                can all have an effect on the resistance to lightning. An inspection of your 
                                lightning protection and a review of what’s now available could save you a lot
                                 of headaches, and perhaps save you from seeing stars.</p>
