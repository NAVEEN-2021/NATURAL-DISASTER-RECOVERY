                <p>General overview on how a WILDFIRE occurs</p>
                <p>A wildfire is an uncontrolled fire in an area of combustible vegetation.  </p>
                <h3><u>Wildfires can:</u></h3>
                <p>Happen anytime provided that fuel,oxygen and heat(the 3 parameters for a fire) are present.</p>            
                <p>Sometimes, fires occur naturally, ignited by heat from the sun or a lightning strike.On a hot summer's day when drought conditions peak, something as small as a spark from a train wheel can ignite a raging wildfire.</p>          
                <p>However,most wildfires are because of human carelessness by engaging in activities such as arson, campfires, discarding lit cigarettes, not burning debris properly, playing with matches or fireworks.</p>

                <h2>WHAT SHOULD YOU DO DURING A WILDFIRE?</h2>
                <p>THE THREE BASIC PRINCIPLES TO BE FOLLOWED DURING A WILDFIRE</p>
                <p>1.SHUT OFF THE GAS AND CHECK YOUR VENTS.BE READY TO EVACUATE</p>
                <p>2.WET DOWN THE PLACE YOU ARE LOCATED BY PLACING LAWN SPRINKLERS ON THE ROOF AND NEAR ABOVE GROUD FUEL TANKS.</p>
                <p>3.HAVE AN EMERGENCY KIT AND LISTEN TO EMERGENCY OFFICIALS THROUGH RADIO.</p>
                <p>MAKE YOUR HOME EASY TO SPOT AND MAKE IT EASY FOR FIREFIGHTERS TO COME IN</p>
                <p>**The most important thing to remember is <span id="dp">DON'T PANIC</span>!!!</p>

                <p>If you are in a house</p>
                   <p>&#9632 Shut off your gas and check your vents.Close all windows and doors, including pet doors.
                  Close garage doors, and disconnect electric openers, even if the power goes out. </p>
                   <p>&#9632 Move furniture away from windows and doors. Remove lightweight or non-fire-resistant window treatments. Put combustible patio furniture, doormats, toys, and trash cans inside the house or garage. </p>
                    <p>&#9632 If your home is gated, leave the gate propped open to allow fire fighters easy access to your property. 
                        Connect garden hoses to outside taps. Fill buckets with water and place them around the house. 
                        Put a ladder against a corner of your house</p>
                <p>&#9632  If you have time, rake dead leaves away from the home and from under wood decks and clear the 
                    roof of any pine needles.

                <p>If you are in a car or truck</p>
                <p>&#9632Stay in your car. Though driving through wildfire is dangerous, it is much less dangerous than trying to run from a fire on foot. Do not run! Roll up windows and close air vents. Be prepared for discomfort.Engines may stall and be tough to restart. </p>
               <p> &#9632 Keep your vehicle as visible as possible and drive slowly with headlights on.Avoid driving through heavy smoke and watch out for other vehicles and pedestrians.</p>
                <p>&#9632 If you have to stop,avoid parking near heavy trees and brush and roll up windows and close air vents.Turn the headlights on and the ignition off and get on the floor and cover up with a blanket or coat and stay in the vehicle until the main fire passes. </p>

                    <p>&#9632 Close doors, but leave them unlocked.</p>
                    <p>&#9632 Try to remain calm and, if you are with other people, stay together</p>
                    <p>&#9632 Have your fire extinguishers out and ready to use.Fill sinks, tubs, and buckets with water for extinguishing any embers that enter the space as well as for drinking and flushing toilets.</p>
                <p>&#9632 Plan for loss of power. Have flashlights and batteries ready.</p>
                <p>&#9632 Disconnect electric garage door openers. Operate doors manually.</p>

                    <h1>Prepare before a WildFire</h1>
                    <p>&#9632 Don't burn dangerous things such as pressurized container spray cans. They may explode.Similarly, never burn glass in a fire. Glass does not melt away; it only heats up and shatters, leaving dangerous slivers.</p>
                    <p>&#9632 Never drop smoking materials onto brush, leaves, or areas that have been mulched.If necessary, grind out your cigarette, cigar, or pipe tobacco in the dirt – never on a stump or log – and carry out the butts.</p>
                    <p>&#9632 When picking a spot for a campfire, do not build a fire where it is too dry or windy or where campfires are prohibited. Remove any grass, twigs, leaves and firewood.</p>
                    <p>&#9632 Pay attention to weather reports.
                         Meteorologists can predict when conditions might be right for a wildfire.</p>
                    <p>&#9632 Learn about hazards in your area and post emergency phone numbers by every phone.Also practice evacuation plans.</p>

                        <h2>DEMONSTRATION ON BUILDING WILDFIRE RESISTANT BUILDINGS</h2>
                        <p>FOLLOW THESE STEPS TO BUILD YOUR WILDFIRE RESISTANT BULDING</p>
                        <p>Site Layout<br>
                             The first strategy is to get a hundred feet of distance and incombustible material between you and the wildlands using patios, driveways, or low-growing fire-retardant plants. You can be attacked from any direction, but an up-slope running fire is by far the most dangerous and so deserves special design attention. .</p>
                        <p>Window Protection<br>
                            Windows are the weakest link in defending your building, but there are clever ways to protect them. Radiant heat alone from the fire can shatter glass or ignite combustibles inside your living room, without the flames actually reaching your house. Single glazing is particularly vulnerable; a better choice is double glazing with tempered glass on the exterior. However the safest solution are roll-down metal fire doors built into the roof overhangs or side recesses, and released automatically by fusible links. They will protect windows and sliding glass doors even if they are left standing open. 
                            </p>
                        <p>Doors<br>
                            Solid core wood doors are usually rated at 20 minutes of fire protection, but instead for extra safety consider a metal core door that can be faced in any material you like, and for added safety use a metal jamb. </p>
                        <p>Louvers and Vents<br>
                           ouses have lots of other holes in them that need to be protected. Large vents in the attics and under-floors, can be protected by fire dampers with fusible links like those built into the heating ducts of all large public buildings.Check that all your bathroom, dryer, and kitchen vents have automatic back-draft dampers and fire-rated assemblies where they penetrate the exterior skin of your building. All metal sleeves and hoods should cover plastic plumbing vents where they penetrate your roof.</p>
                        <p>Special Equipments<br>
                            Sprinkler heads on the roof or protecting patios and decks can turn themselves on automatically with a valve that is opened by a fusible link. Design your system so that once the firestorm has passed over your house it can put out all the spot fires on the roof and next to your walls. Assume that at the worst possible moment your house will probably loose both electric power and water pressure, so you might consider a portable generator that will automatically power exterior lights and pump water out of your pool.
