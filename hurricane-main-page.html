                <p>General overview on how a hurricane occurs</p>
                <p>Hurricanes are massive storm systems that form over warm ocean 
                        waters and move toward land. Potential threats from hurricanes include powerful winds, 
                        heavy rainfall, storm surges, coastal and inland flooding, rip currents, tornadoes, and landslides./p>
                <h3><u>Hurricanes can:</u></h3>
                <p>Cause Storm surge that pushes seawater on shore during a hurricane, 
                        flooding towns near the coast.</p>            
                <p>Can affect areas more than 100 miles inland.</p>                
                <p>Causes heavy rains that result in many issues.</p>

                <p>THE THREE BASIC PRINCIPLES TO BE FOLLOWED DURING AN TORNADO</p>
                <p>1.WHEN THE STORM IS NEAR ,MAKE SURE THAT IT NEVER CATCHES YOU BY SURPRISE</p>
                <p>2.GATHER ALL YOUR EMERGENCY SUPPLIES</p>
                <p>3.PLACE ALL THE FURNITURE INSIDE YOUR HOUSE AS THEY BECOME DEBRI.</p>
                <p>STORE VALUABLE DOCUMENTS IN WATERPROOF COVERS</p>
                <p>**The most important thing to remember is <span id="dp">DON'T PANIC</span>!!!</p>

                <p>If you are in a house</p>
                   <p>&#9632 Use a portable radio to listen to important storm updates, information and instructions.</p>
                   <p>&#9632  Stay inside and keep away from all windows, skylights and glass doors. Go to a safe area, 
                       such as an interior room, closet or downstairs bathroom</p>
                    <p>&#9632 •	If power is lost, keep the refrigerator closed to keep cold 
                        air trapped and delay spoilage of perishable food.</p></p>

                <p>If you are in a car or truck</p>
                <p>&#9632  Vehicles are extremely risky in a hurricanes as they get sucked by storm. 
                    There is no safe option when caught in a tornado in a car, just slightly less-dangerous ones. </p>
               <p> &#9632 Do not walk, swim, or drive through flood waters. Turn Around.
                    Don’t Drown! Just six inches of fast-moving water can knock you down,
                     and one foot of moving water can sweep your vehicle away.</p>
                <p>&#9632  Stay off of bridges over fast-moving water.
                        Listen for current emergency information and instructions.</p></p>

                    <p>If you are in a mobile home</p>
                    <p>&#9632 Make sure your address number is clearly marked on your mobile home.
                            Check and secure all of your mobile home's tie-downs.</p> 
                    <p>&#9632 Go to one of those shelters, or to a nearby permanent structure,
                         . Most hurricanes can destroy even tied-down mobile homes. </p>
                    <p>&#9632  Trim dead or broken branches from trees.</p></p>
                    <p>&#9632 Use child safety locks on cupboards to help keep items like plates,
                         glasses and canned goods from spilling out.</p>

                    <p>&#9632 Know your area’s risk of hurricanes. 
                        Know the signs of a hurricanes, including a heavy rains, spiral clouds and fast moving wind</p>
                    <p>&#9632 Practice going to a safe shelter for high winds, such as a FEMA safe
                         room or ICC 500 storm shelter. The next best protection is a small, interior, 
                         windowless room in a sturdy building on the lowest level that is not subject to flooding.</p>
                    <p>&#9632Based on your location and community plans, make your own plans for evacuation or sheltering in place.
                            Become familiar with your evacuation zone, the evacuation route, and shelter locations</p>
                    <p>&#9632Gather needed supplies for at least three days. 
                        Keep in mind each person’s specific needs, including medication. Don’t forget the needs of pets.</p>
                    <p>&#9632 Keep important documents in a safe place or create password-protected digital copies.
                            Protect your property. Declutter drains and gutters.
                             Install check valves in plumbing to prevent backups. Consider 
                             hurricane shutters. Review insurance policies.</p>

                        <h2>DEMONSTRATION ON BUILDING HURRICANE RESISTANT BUILDINGS</h2>
                        <p>FOLLOW THESE STEPS TO BUILD YOUR HURRICANE RESISTANT BULDING</p>
                        <p>Although many of today’s brand-new homes are safer than older homes,
                             it’s not a rule that you must start from scratch. By performing a 
                             few must-have modifications it’s possible to increase your home’s 
                             protection from high-speed winds and flooding.</p>
                        <p>Hurricane Shutters<br>
                            During a torrential storm, a broken window can lead to severe damage. 
                            Not only will it increase the likelihood of structural damage to the 
                            home, but it can also allow a hurricane’s wrath to inflict severe damage 
                            to the home’s contents. It also increases the chance of flooding inside 
                            the home, which can lead to costly and extensive repairs.</p>
                        <p> Impact-Resistant Windows & Doors<br>
                            Storm windows and exterior doors can also be helpful in keeping your
                             home safe when disaster strikes. Storm windows are equipped with
                              double-panes and air-tight seals, while doors are constructed of heavy 
                              metal or similarly durable material.</p>
                        <p> Resilient Construction Materials<br>
                            The material that makes up the greatest part of your home should 
                            be highly prioritized to offer the greatest possible protection against 
                            hurricanes. Concrete is one of the most resilient construction materials
                             available. Homes that are built using concrete often have a much greater
                              ability to withstand strong wind and rain than those built with wood,
                               brick or paneling. Resilient walls that are fortified by concrete and
                                include a double-panel system should be used throughout the home when
                                 possible.</p>
                        <p>Direct the Wind Path Away From Your Home<br>
                            Homeowners can take measures to direct a heavy wind load away 
                            from the roof and walls and towards the home’s foundation. This 
                            can be done with the help of tie-down straps, hurricane plates, and
                             clips, cable ties, and other types of tie-down products. It’s easiest 
                             to direct wind away from a one-story home, rather than a home of multiple levels.</p>
                             <p>Consider the Costs<br>
                                If you do choose to implement hurricane-resistant features on an existing 
                                structure, you should know that these modifications typically double the cost
                                 of construction. This means that the larger your home is, the greater you can
                                  expect the cost to modify it. </p>
