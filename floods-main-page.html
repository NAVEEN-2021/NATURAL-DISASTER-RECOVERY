                <p>General overview on how Floods happens</p>
                <p>Flooding is the overflow of excess water from a water body onto 
                        adjacent lands. FEMA  defines a flood as a general and temporary 
                        condition of partial or complete inundation of normally dry land areas from 
                        the overflow of inland surface waters from any source.</p>
                <h3><u>Floods can:</u></h3>
                <p>Cause direct damage during a flood from inundation, high velocity
                    flow, waves, erosion, sedimentation and/or flood-borne debris</p>            
                <p>Bring intense winds, over 200 MPH</p>

                <h2>WHAT SHOULD YOU DO DURING FLOODS?</h2>
                <p>THE THREE BASIC PRINCIPLES TO BE FOLLOWED DURING FLOODS</p>
                <p>1.DON'T TRY TO SWIM IN FLOOD WATER AS THEY CAN KNOCK YOU DOWN</p>
                <p>2.STAY OFF THE BRIDGES OVER THE FAST MOVING WATERS</p>
                <p>3.MOVE TO THE HIGHEST GROUND AS POSSIBLE</p>
                <p>STAY WHERE YOU ARE TILL YOU GET HELP</p>

                   <p>&#9632 Vacate your home when you are advised to do so by local emergency authorities. Ignoring such a warning could 
                       jeopardize the safety of your family or those who might eventually have to come to your rescue.</p>
                   <p>&#9632  Take your emergency kit with you. </p>
                    <p>&#9632 Follow the routes specified by officials. Don't take shortcuts. They could lead you to a blocked or dangerous area.</p></p>

               <p> &#9632Stay on high ground. Do not stay in a flooded car. If your vehicle is surrounded by
                    floodwater, abandon the vehicle and move immediately to higher ground.</p>
                <p>&#9632  If your car is swept into the water and submerged DON'T PANIC! 
                    Stay calm and wait for the vehicle to fill with water. 
                    Once the vehicle is full, the doors will open. Hold your breath and swim to the surface.</p></p>

                        <h2>DEMONSTRATION ON BUILDING FLOOD RESISTANT BUILDINGS</h2>
                        <p>FOLLOW THESE STEPS TO BUILD YOUR FLOOD RESISTANT BULDING</p>
                        <p>Elevation<br>
                            This is the oldest and most obvious way to build a flood proof house. 
                            If you must build near a river or the sea, just make sure you lift your building
                             above the likely height of the flood waters. There are a number of ways to do that. 
                             You can build a house on stilts, a traditional form in many places. You can build it on
                              a raised platform like a beach house, or on a bank of earth or concrete. Larger office buildings
                               might put a sacrificial car park underneath. A treehouse could also fall into this category.</p>
                        <p>Floodwalls<br>
                            Rather than raise your home above the waters, a second common technique 
                            is to protect your home or property from the water by building a sturdy and waterproof wall.
                             This can be done to protect whole towns and villages, but there’s no reason why it can’t be done on
                              individual dwellings. Perimeter walls with watertight gates are one approach. You can also incorporate
                               berms and walls into the landscaping, keeping the water out of a whole property or allowing the garden 
                               to flood while protecting the house</p>
                        <p>Dry floodproofing<br>
                            Rather than keeping the water out of a building, an alternative approach is to let it 
                            in but minimise the damage it can do: fit a solid floor rather than wood, move power outlets
                             up the wall and ensure that any unmovable furniture is made of a material that can safely take
                              a soaking. Wet floodproofing is often used to retrofit flood-prone properties that the owners 
                              can’t sell, which is making the best of a bad situation. </p>
                        <p>Wet floodproofing<br>
                            Shattered windows can cause serious injury. The best protection—especially if you’re building
                             a new house or remodeling and existing one—is to install impact-resistant windows.
                              They are more expensive to buy, but they can be customized to the 
                              space and provide better protection. Depending on where the house is located, they 
                              also may be required by the local building code, especially in coastal areas.</p>
                        <p>Floating homes<br>
                            Second-guessing how far future floodwaters might rise is a dangerous 
                            game in an age of climate change. If your house can float, it’s guaranteed to always
                             be above the water. One way to do it is to build on pontoons and have a building that’s always floating.<br>
                             Amphibious houses are slightly different. They’re on land and only float when there’s a flood. </p>
