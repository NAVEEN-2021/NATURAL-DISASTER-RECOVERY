                <p>General overview on how a tornado occurs</p>
                <p>Tornadoes can destroy buildings, flip cars, and create deadly
                    flying debris. Tornadoes are violently rotating 
                    columns of air that extend from a thunderstorm to the ground.  </p>
                <h3><u>Tornadoes can:</u></h3>
                <p>Happen anytime and anywhere;</p>            
                <p>Bring intense winds, over 200 MPH</p>

                <p>1.GO TO A ROOMS OR BASEMENT OR STORM CELLAR</p>
                <p>2.STAY AWAY FROM WIDOWS,DOORS AND OUTSIDE WALLS</p>
                <p>3.DO NOT GET UNDER AN OVERPASS OR BRIDGE</p>

                <p>If you are in a house</p>
                   <p>&#9632 Avoid windows. Get in the basement and under some kind of sturdy protection (heavy table or work bench), or cover yourself with a mattress or sleeping bag. </p>
                   <p>&#9632  Know where very heavy objects rest on the floor above (pianos, refrigerators, waterbeds, etc.) and do not go under them. </p>
                    <p>&#9632 They may fall down through a weakened floor and crush you. Head protection, such as a helmet, can boost survivability also</p></p>

                <p>&#9632  Vehicles are extremely risky in a tornado. 
                    There is no safe option when caught in a tornado in a car, just slightly less-dangerous ones. </p>
               <p> &#9632 f the tornado is visible, far away, and the traffic is light,
                    you may be able to drive out of its path by moving at right angles to the tornado.
                    Seek shelter in a sturdy building possible.</p>
                <p>&#9632  If you can safely get noticeably lower than the level

                        <h2>DEMONSTRATION ON BUILDING TORNADO RESISTANT BUILDINGS</h2>
                        <p>FOLLOW THESE STEPS TO BUILD YOUR TORNADO RESISTANT BULDING</p>
                        <p>Secure entry doors<br>
                            Ensure that entry doors have a two-inch deadbolt lock and three hinges, with screws long
                                enough to secure the door and frame to the wall framing. 
                                Streem stresses that the framing aspect is the most critical element, and it has 
                                to be the most secure.</p>
                        <p>Brace garage doors<br>
                            Your garage door—the largest potential opening in your home—is another vulnerable point,
                             Streem explains.If the garage door goes missing, is left open or is taken out, it 
                             completely compromises the structure of your home.</p>
                        <p>Protect important documents and valuables<br>
                            Recomended that storing your important papers and valuable possessions in a fire-proof safe or 
                            safety deposit box to ensure that you’ll be able to access them after a tornado. </p>
                        <p>Install impact-resistant windows<br>
                            Shattered windows can cause serious injury. The best protection—especially if you’re building
                             a new house or remodeling and existing one—is to install impact-resistant windows.
                              They are more expensive to buy, but they can be customized to the 
                              space and provide better protection. Depending on where the house is located, they 
                              also may be required by the local building code, especially in coastal areas.</p>
                        <p>Install wind-resistant roof structures<br>
                            Roof sheathing and covering should be rated to resist high winds. 
                            Generally, a home’s roof is attached with roofing nails, which are inserted at an angle,
                             but this kind of roof can come right off. Recomended that attaching roofs with hurricane clips, 
                             which create a stronger connection between the roof and the house. The clips come in a range of 
                             protections, depending on the clip you buy and the weight of your roof.</p>
                             <p>Prepare your home shelter<br>
                                If you live in a tornado-prone area, it is recommended that preparing your 
                                home shelter location by stocking it with essential items such as a battery-powered radio, 
                                a flashlight, spare batteries, water and snack food like energy bars—anything you don’t have to cook.</p>
