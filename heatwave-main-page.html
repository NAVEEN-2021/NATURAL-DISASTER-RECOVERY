                <p>General overview on how a HEAT-WAVE happens</p>
                <p>Heat Wave often results in the highest number of annual deaths among 
                        all weather-related hazards. In most areas, extreme heat
                         is defined as a long period of high heat and humidity with
                          temperatures above 90 degrees. In extreme heat body must work
                           extra hard to maintain a normal temperature. </p>
                <h3><u>Heatwave can:</u></h3>
                <p>It creates the ideal environment for the break-out of a wildfire</p>            
                <p> Blackouts resulted during this event due to damaged power transformers.</p>                
                <p>Power transformers can detonate causing fires.</p>

                <h2>WHAT SHOULD YOU DO DURING A HEATWAVE?</h2>
                <p>THE THREE BASIC PRINCIPLES TO BE FOLLOWED DURING AN HEATWAVE</p>
                <p>1.FIND AIR CONDITIONING AND MOVE THERE</p>
                <p>2.WEAR LIGHT CLOTHING</p>
                <p>3.DRINK PLENTY OF FLUIDS AND STAY HYDRATED</p>
                <p>DON'T LEAVE PETS OR PEOPLE IN CAR DURING HEAT WAVE.</p>

                <p>If you are in a house</p>
                   <p>&#9632 Our first instinct on a lovely summer’s day is to open the curtains and let the sunshine in. 
                       However, you’re essentially transforming your home into a greenhouse by doing so.</p>
                   <p>&#9632 Keep your curtains or blinds closed throughout the day. If you want something a little
                        more heavy duty, consider getting some black out blinds to help keep the heat out.</p>
                <p>&#9632 An electric fan might seem like the obvious go to when temperatures start to rise 
                     but there’s a helpful trick you can use to make it even cooler. Place a bowl of icy 
                     water in front of the fan. As the ice evaporates, it will make the air feel pleasantly cool.</p>
                    <!-- <p>&#9632 Fill your water bottle with cold water and then stick it in the freezer. 
                        You’ll have your homemade ice pack ready for when you need it most.</p>-->  </p>

                <p>If you are in a car</p>
                <p>&#9632 Scorching hot days aren’t friendly to your car battery.
                     So before summer weather hits, have your battery tested to ensure it’s in tiptop shape. </p>
               <p> &#9632 During a heat wave, it’s especially important to check your fluids since they help to cool down the engine. 
                   This includes motor oil, brake fluid, transmission fluid and power steering fluid.</p>
                <p>&#9632When you’re looking for a parking place, try to find a shady spot or a
                     parking area that’s underground or shielded from direct sunlight.
                     Sunlight and hot temperatures can fade your vehicle’s exterior</p></p>

                    <p>If you are on the Beach?</p>
                    <p>&#9632 Be aware of heat illness  as heat illness occurs when the body cannot cool down.
                         The most serious forms of heat illness are heat exhaustion and heat stroke.</p> 
                    <p>&#9632Make sure you avoid strenuous activity, especially during the sun’s peak hours of 11 a.m. to 4 p.m.
                         On Sunday, dangerous temperatures are expected to last until 9 p.m.</p>
                    <p>&#9632 Due to the heat wave, the city Parks Department extended the hours of its pools citywide.
                            Prevent heat illness by staying in an air-conditioned place.

                        <h2>DEMONSTRATION ON BUILDING HEATWAVE RESISTANT BUILDINGS</h2>
                        <p>FOLLOW THESE STEPS TO BUILD YOUR HEATWAVE RESISTANT BULDING</p>
                        <p>Although many of today’s brand-new homes are safer than older homes,
                             it’s not a rule that you must start from scratch. By performing a 
                             few must-have modifications it’s possible to increase your home’s 
                             protection from lightning.</p>
                        <p> Protecting against the sun<br>
                            Limit the “greenhouse” effect. Draw curtains, lower blinds and close shutters, 
                            especially in rooms that are exposed to the sun. Choose pale colours. 
                            They will reflect both the light and the heat, rather than absorbing them.
                            Keep bedrooms in the dark during the day.</p>
                        <p> Protect your windows from heat<br>
                            Fit protective films to your windows. They will filter the UV rays
                             and reduce the effect of the sun in living rooms but still let the light in.</p>
                        <p>  Keeping the heat outside<br>
                            Have your roof insulated, especially if you have bedrooms under the eaves.
                             Properly insulated walls will protect you against the heat as well as against
                              the cold. Keep your windows closed when it’s hot. Switch off unnecessary heat sources:
                               Chargers, even when they are not charging, devices on stand-by and computers 
                               all give off a fair amount of heat – unplug anything that could be an unwanted 
                               heat source. Do not do any cooking in the oven and stick to cold dishes.</p>
                        <p>Letting cool air in<br>
                            Air at night and create draughts to ensure that the cool air circulates 
                            around the house. Use a ceiling fan to stir up the hot air that has gathered 
                            overhead; this will eliminate some of the humidity created due to condensation and sweat.</p>
                             <p>Hack the heat without AC<br>
                                If you're eco-conscious then you'll want to stay away from air conditioning - 
                                which, thanks to the immense amounts of electricity needed to power them, have been
                                 linked to greenhouse gas emissions.But in 40C heat, this is easier said than done.</p>
