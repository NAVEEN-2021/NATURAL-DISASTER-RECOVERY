                <p>General overview on how a LAND SLIDE occurs</p>
                <p>In a landslide, masses of rock, earth or debris move down a slope. 
                        Debris and mud flows are rivers of rock, earth, and other debris saturated with
                         water. They develop during intense rainfall, runoff, or rapid snowmelt, 
                         changing the earth into a flowing river of mud or “slurry.” They can flow rapidly,
                          striking with little or no warning at avalanche speeds .</p>
                <h3><u>Landslide can:</u></h3>
                <p>It creates slurry mud which flows like viscous liquid</p>            
                <p>The consistencies of debris flows range from watery mud to thick.</p>                
                <p> Results in blockage of roads.</p>

                <h2>WHAT SHOULD YOU DO DURING A LANDSLIDE?</h2>
                <p>THE THREE BASIC PRINCIPLES TO BE FOLLOWED DURING A LANDSLIDE</p>
                <p>1.STAY ALERT AND AWAKE</p>
                <p>2.NEVER CROSS A BRIDGE IF YOU SEE A FLOW APPROACHING</p>
                <p>3.MOVE TO UPHILL AREAS</p>
                <p>MAKE EMERGENCY CONTACT TO YOUR LOCAL AUTHORITIES</p>

                <p>If you are in a house</p>
                   <p>&#9632 If you are with other people, work together to keep one another awake.</p>
                   <p>&#9632 Watch and listen for warning signs of nearby landslide, including sounds of falling debris or changes in water clarity or flow.
                        It is imperative that you familiarize yourself with landslide warning signs, especially if you live in an at-risk area.</p>
                <p>&#9632 Keep reading to learn more about landslide warning signs in detail.</p>
                    <!-- <p>&#9632 Fill your water bottle with cold water and then stick it in the freezer. 
                        You’ll have your homemade ice pack ready for when you need it most.</p>-->  </p>

                <p>If you are in a car</p>
                <p>&#9632  If you need to drive to leave a dangerous area, proceed with caution. Beware of flooded roads,
                     collapsed pavement, fallen debris, and washed-out bridges. </p>
               <p> &#9632  DO NOT cross flooded streams--instead, turn around and try to find an alternative route.</p>
                <p>&#9632When  Landslides move very quickly--much faster than you can run or walk.
                     Trying to outrun a landslide is futile. Instead, remove yourself as
                      fast as you can from the path of the landslide</p></p>

                    <p>If you are on hiking</p>
                    <p>&#9632 If you’re stuck outdoors with no shelter in sight you might have no other option
                         than to try and escape its path. This option only works if the landslide is slow moving—if you try and 
                         flee from a fast landslide it’ll overtake you. If it’s slow, you might be able to move far enough
                         sideways to get out of the way before it hits—just don’t run in the same direction it’s moving.</p> 
                    <p>&#9632Most land or mudslides are too large and quick to run away from. Your best bet,
                         if you can’t find reliable shelter,</p>
                    <p>&#9632 Stick to the highest ground and hold some steady trees</p>

                    <p>&#9632 Consult a professional for advice on appropriate preventative measures for your home or business,
                         such as flexible pipe fittings, which can better resist breakage.</p>
                    <p>&#9632 Protect your property based on of recommendations from the ‘qualified geotechnical professional’ and/or local 
                        city/county guidance on protection from debris flow and flooding.</p>
                    <p>&#9632 Become familiar with the land around you </p>

                        <p>FOLLOW THESE STEPS TO BUILD YOUR LANDSLIDE RESISTANT BULDING</p>
                        <p>Although many of today’s brand-new homes are safer than older homes,
                             it’s not a rule that you must start from scratch. By performing a 
                             few must-have modifications it’s possible to increase your home’s 
                             protection from lightning.</p>
                        <p> Classification of Critical Infrastructure<br>
                            To develop the guidelines and special provisions for disaster flexibility of 
                            buildings which are part of the critical infrastructure, the initial step would
                             be to define and classify them with prevailing categories in the building codes.</p>
                        <p>  Hazard Identification<br>
                            Based on the building location and hazards map analysis, the main hazards which can disturb the critical
                             infrastructure needs to be identified.
                             Considering these hazards during the planning and location phase help in mitigating landslides and flood-related dangers.</p>
                        <p>  Hazard Assessment<br>
                            Once the hazards are identified after referring to the available hazard maps 
                            (for both floods and landslides), they should be further deeply evaluated. 
                            Dependent on the type and scale of the maps, added information on the specific
                             hazard sub type and its intensity should be determined for the building location.</p>
                        <p>. Determining Building Characteristics For Landslide Resistance<br>
                            The dangers buildings face due to landslides is a combination of the total 
                            hazards posed by the location, the vulnerability of the specific site characteristics, 
                            and the vulnerability of the building structure characteristics. Some types of building 
                            structures are more exposed than the others. <br>
                            Design professionals would agree that the most successful way to alleviate 
                            losses of life, property, and function is to construct buildings that are
                             structurally strong and disaster-resistant. This approach should be incorporated 
                             into your project planning, design, and development at the earliest possible stage
                              to ensure your design and material decisions are based on an integrated and all-inclusive approach.</p>
